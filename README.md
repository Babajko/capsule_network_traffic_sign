# Traffic sign recognition with capsule networks.

Code for AI Ukraine 2018 workshop "Introduction to Capsule Networks"

1. To prepare for the workshop, please:

    - Download Python notebook.
    - Register/try Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/notebook
    - Use notebook in Google Colab (preffered way) or install dependencies and run notebook locally.
            
3. Dataset used: German Traffic Sign Dataset. http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset
This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.
You can compare other models with other implementations.

Pickled, prepared dataset you can find here:  https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip (This scaled and pickled dataset was taken from the source: https://github.com/mohamedameen93/German-Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-TensorFlow ,  you can find LeNet-5 and VGGNet models implementation for this dataset)

4. Final version of the notebook with source will be provided during the presentation at workshop.
